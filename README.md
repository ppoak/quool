This is a project aimed for quant, or people want to devote themselves in quantative field. I concluded a lot of experience and sample codes in this project covering from data collection, quantative investment platform to actual factor digging process and so on. This project is still carrying on and ready to bring everyone in quantative field a better experience.

## How can we use this project?

Currently, I have no plan for publishing a independent pypi package for this project, for most of the code is created in research process. I you find some of the code in this project do help you, you can try to clone the project to your own computer, and import the corresponding package. More easily, just copy and paste the code in your project.
